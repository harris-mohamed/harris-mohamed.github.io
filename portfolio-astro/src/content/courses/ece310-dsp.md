## Course Description

ECE 310: Digital Signal Processing covers the theory of Digital Signal Processing. The course was heavy in mathematics, but the concepts from this class show up in several places: the lab, internships, and real-world applications. The associated lab section (ECE 311) used Python to visualize many of the concepts taught in the classroom.

## Topics Covered

- **Discrete-time linear shift-invariant systems**
- **Difference equations**
- **Convolution and impulse response**
- **Z-transform**
- **Transfer functions and block diagrams**
- **Discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT)**
- **Sampling Theory**
- **A/D and D/A conversion**

## Lab Component (ECE 311)

The lab section provided hands-on experience with DSP concepts:
- Python implementation of DSP algorithms
- Visualization of frequency and time domain signals
- Practical applications of theoretical concepts
- Signal analysis and processing

## Skills Gained

- Digital signal processing theory
- Z-transform analysis
- DTFT and frequency domain analysis
- Sampling and quantization
- Python signal processing
- Filter design fundamentals
- Time and frequency domain conversion
- Mathematical signal analysis
