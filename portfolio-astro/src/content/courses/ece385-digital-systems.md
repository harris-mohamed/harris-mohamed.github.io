## Course Description

ECE 385: Digital Systems Lab covers several topics that are important to the field of programming and using FPGAs. Similar to parallel programming, impressive speedups can be achieved using FPGAs. This was one of the favorite courses, providing hands-on experience with FPGA development and digital system design.

## Topics Covered

- **Combinational logic circuits** - Basic digital logic design
- **Storage elements** - Registers, flip-flops, and memory
- **Hazards and race conditions** - Timing analysis and prevention
- **Circuit characteristics** - fanout, delays, propagation times
- **Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)** - Architecture and programming
- **Combinational networks** - adders, multiplexers, etc. in SystemVerilog
- **Sequential networks** - counters, shift registers, etc. in SystemVerilog
- **Synchronous state machines** - FSM design and implementation
- **Static timing analysis** - clock domains, metastability, and synchronization
- **Logic simulation and testbenches** - Verification methodology
- **Microprocessors and system on chip** - Embedded processor integration
