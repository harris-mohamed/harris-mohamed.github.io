## Project Overview

Sentinel is a real-time LIDAR point cloud classification system developed as part of my undergraduate research. The system leverages FPGA acceleration to achieve real-time performance for autonomous vehicle applications.

## Key Contributions

- Developed custom FPGA architecture for point cloud processing
- Implemented machine learning inference in hardware
- Achieved 10x speedup compared to software implementations

## Results

The system was successfully demonstrated on a test vehicle and showed promising results for real-time object detection and classification in urban environments.
