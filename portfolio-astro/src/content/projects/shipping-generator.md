## Overview

The first programming language I learned was Javascript. From there, I use Codeacademy to learn HTML and CSS, and I was cranking out simple, unaesthetic webpages like nobody's business. During high school, a trend that took off (and is still extremely relevant today) is "shipping" people together. "Ship" is short for relationship, and it essentially means pairing people together as couples. This idea led directly to the Shipping Generator. We loaded everyone's name from our classes, and everytime "Generate" was clicked, a boy's name and a girl's name would be chosen at random. Incredibly simple, but the project took off and soared in popularity. The generator got hundreds of page requests a week, a lot of which was actually during class time, since the website was not blocked by the firewall. People began asking for more features, the most prominent of which ended up being a leaderboard. Designing a leaderboard in high school with no concept of what databases were was actually a difficult task, but we ended up having the website complete a Google Form and then had a public readonly spreadsheet where we sorted the results. This led to people figuring this out and filling out the forms themselves, which led to us adding in obfuscation and security features. While rudimentary, still one of my favorite projects that I have worked on.
