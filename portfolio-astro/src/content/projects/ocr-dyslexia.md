## Overview

As part of the 2018 ECE PULSE competition, me and 3 other group members interfaced a Tobii eye tracker with a C# application to assist those with dyslexia. This would operate by using OCR to analyze when someone is trying to read text on a computer screen and based on how long someone is looking at text, analyze if they are having trouble reading it. Then, it can take the data and then graph it. Due to time constraints, we were only able to get the eye tracker data and figure out what parts of the screen were being looked at. We were 2nd place runners up in the competition.
