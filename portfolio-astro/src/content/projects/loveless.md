## Overview

I recently downloaded and began visualizing some of my Facebook Messenger messaging data, which led me to consider what an AI would think of my messages. This project will use AI to analyze intent, emotion, mood, and predict future messages. 

Originally, I intended to revisit this project. However, the advent of mature LLMs actually led me to abandon this project. I might return to it at some point, but as of 2026 this is abandoned.
