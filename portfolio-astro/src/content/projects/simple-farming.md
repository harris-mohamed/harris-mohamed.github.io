## Overview

For my internet of things class, I designed and implemented an automated farming setup. I grew lettuce, tomatoes, and strawberries indoors. The water delivery was automated, and the plants were monitored with a real-time dashboard using several sensors (temperate, soil moisture, etc.). A camera was set up to capture a time lapse. A video summarizing my conclusion can be found at the link below:
