## Project Overview

This project combines my interests in hardware, software, and sustainable agriculture. The goal is to create a fully automated vertical farming system that can grow fresh produce year-round with minimal human intervention.

## Features

### Hardware Components
- Multi-tier vertical growing structure
- LED grow lights with programmable spectrums
- Hydroponic nutrient delivery system
- Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, pH, EC)
- Automated water pumps and nutrient dosing

### Software & IoT
- Real-time environmental monitoring
- Automated climate control
- Remote access via web dashboard
- Data logging and analytics
- Alert system for anomalies

### Current Progress
- Hardware assembly: 80% complete
- Sensor integration: Complete
- Automated control system: In development
- Web dashboard: Planned

## Goals

The ultimate goal is to create a sustainable, efficient system that can be replicated for urban farming applications, reducing food miles and providing fresh produce in areas with limited agricultural space.

## Next Steps
- Complete automation software
- Optimize nutrient delivery algorithms
- Implement machine learning for predictive yield optimization
- Document build process for open-source release
