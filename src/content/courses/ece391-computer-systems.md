## Course Description

ECE 391: Computer Systems Engineering is all about the synthesis between hardware and software, working together to make a Linux-like operating system. This starts from nothing more than a few boot files. The final operating system has a read-only filesystem, interrupt support, device support (Keyboard, Interrupt Controller, Real time clock), paging, and a round-robin scheduler for multitasking. The operating system was completed in a group of 4.

## Topics Covered

- **Interfacing C to assembly** - macros, stack frame and calling convention
- **Synchronization** - primitives, memory semantics, mutual exclusion, semaphores, scheduling, and race conditions
- **Interrupts** - controlling generation and handling, chaining, cleanup code, interactions with device functionality
- **Resource management** - virtualization and protection, virtual memory and hardware support
- **Exceptions and signals** - exceptions due to instructions, memory accesses, and floating-point operations; signal semantics and delivery
- **Device programming** - basic abstractions, character and block devices
- **File system abstractions** - disk layout, access control lists and capabilities, log-structured and traditional filesystems as design problem
- **I/O interface** - file descriptors, buffering, control operations, memory mapping

## Key Projects

Built a complete Linux-like operating system from scratch featuring:
- Read-only filesystem
