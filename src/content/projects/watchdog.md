## Overview

innovateFPGA is a competition hosted by Terasic, where FPGAs are applied towards problems that involve AI at the edge. In this vein, my colleague and I submitted a proposal for Project Watchdog, an FPGA-based smart home security camera that performed all classification locally and only sent the output of the classification to a computer, thus reducing the amount of bandwidth needed to send video to an external server. In addition, this solution does not need an internet connection to perform a classification.

We placed as regional finalists in the competition, and our full write-up can be found [here](http://www.innovatefpga.com/cgi-bin/innovate/teams.pl?Id=AS020).
