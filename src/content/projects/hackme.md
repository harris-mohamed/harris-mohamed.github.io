## Overview

Every year, UIUC holds a competition called a Hackathon. The hackathon is a 36-hour competition where the competitors are asked to design (usually code) anything they can think of or find interesting. The goal is to create the most novel and working design in 36 hours. Since I was in an ECE fraternity (HKN), I wanted to create something with hardware to challenge myself, and also help me with job applications for internships.

## Details

The idea is novel, but is a bit ambitious for a 36 hour competition. We set out to develop a non-invasive EEG wave capture device that could map thoughts. Using affordable hardware components and machine learning algorithms, we created a proof-of-concept system that could detect specific thought patterns.

The project involved:
- Hardware assembly and circuit design for EEG sensors
- Signal processing and noise filtering
- Machine learning model training for pattern recognition
- Real-time data visualization interface

### Results

Winner of the HackIllinois 2019:
- Ocean Source Software (presented by Particle)
- The Very Hungry Caterpillar (presented by Caterpillar)
- Runners Up for the event overall

This project demonstrated the potential of accessible brain-computer interfaces and opened doors for future research in this area.
