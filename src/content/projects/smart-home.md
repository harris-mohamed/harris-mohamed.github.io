## Overview

Atlas is a Discord-based AI council system where multiple LLM officers collaborate to strategize, brainstorm, and evaluate ideas. Right now, Atlas can spawn officers with multiple personalities to answer questions and conduct basic research on tasks. I want to grow this out to have the officers able to implement simple POCs using headless Claude Codes.
