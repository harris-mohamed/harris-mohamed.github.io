## Overview

I have always had an interest in 3D design, modeling, and rendering (very much reflected by my research interests). I've been learning Blender ever since I built my new desktop. I am still a novice, but I have a few intro projects I have completed, and have many more planned. I upload all my renders on my VFX YouTube channel, [Ethereal Studios](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtB2neUV9UZ1jPUXb2BsHwA).

More coming soon! I plan to experiment with physics simulations and video compositing.
