## Overview

I was selected to deliver a plenary presentation on my research into detecting electromagnetic interference in passive RF data. The work develops methods for identifying EMI signatures within passive radio frequency datasets, improving signal integrity and operational awareness in contested electromagnetic environments. Methods explored include 1-shot image segmentation models, K-means clustering, and classical statistical methods.
